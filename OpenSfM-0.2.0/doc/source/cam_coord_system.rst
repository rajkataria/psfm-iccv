Camera Coordinate System and Conventions
========================================

Camera
------

The pose of a camera, conceptually, consists of two things:

1. Which direction does it face in, i.e. its local coordinate axes
2. Where is it, i.e. the position of the camera origin

Local coordinate system of camera
`````````````````````````````````
These online docs say that, from the POV of a camera (a.k.a. a ``Shot``
object):

-  The z-axis points **forward**
-  The y-axis points **down**
-  The x-axis points to the **right**

I can confirm, after experimentation, that this is accurate. (In the
3D reconstruction viewer, the axes go Red, Green, Blue: x, y, z.)

The OpenSfM ``Pose`` class contains a ``rotation`` field, representing
the local coordinate system as an **axis-angle vector**.

-  The **direction** of this 3D vector represents the **axis** around
   which to rotate.
-  The **length** of this vector is the **angle** to rotate around said
   axis.

Sounds like it makes sense, but when it actually comes to working with
code, all the hidden conventions crawl out of the shadows.

First is the obviously unstated **unit of angular measurement**. In
computer maths libraries it's generally safe to assume everything's in
**radians**, and it certainly looks like that here.

Next, a "rotation axis" is really just a *line*. But a vector, even a
*unit* vector, defines a line :math:`\lambda\mathbf{v}` with
*orientation*. One direction is "positive scalar", the opposite is
"negative scalar". Could there be a difference between rotating around
:math:`\mathbf{v}` and rotating around :math:`-\mathbf{v}`?

Look at a clock face-on. Pick the axis from its face to your face. It's
rotating clockwise around this axis. Now turn the clock around to face
the opposite direction. Looking through the back of the clock, the hands
rotate *anticlockwise* around the *negative* of the original axis. So
rotating by :math:`\theta` around :math:`-\mathbf{v}` is the
**same** as rotating :math:`-\theta` around :math:`\mathbf{v}`.

Even if we know that two representations are opposite, this still
doesn't tell us which is which. What is a "rotation around the z-axis"?
This sounds like asking whether each axis is clockwise or anticlockwise,
but even this depends on which way you're looking...

Instead, the real question being asked is: Does a rotation by a small
positive angle, around the positive z axis, rotate in the *x-to-y*
direction, or the *y-to-x* direction? And likewise for the other axes.

To find out, I set the rotation vectors to rotate 1 radian around each
of the axes. Results are:

**"Rotate around Z" is Y-to-X**

With ``pose.rotation = [0, 0, 1]``:

|z-is-y-to-x|

**"Rotate around Y" is X-to-Z**

With ``pose.rotation = [0, 1, 0]``:

|y-is-x-to-z|

**"Rotate around X" is Z-to-Y**

With ``pose.rotation = [1, 0, 0]``:

|x-is-z-to-y|

It basically works like this (apologies for ASCII art):

::

         Z ----+
       / |     |
     /   |     V
    ^    |_____Y
    |   /     /
    | /      /
    X <-----+

Where is the camera?
````````````````````

Conceptually, this is a simple translation, in world coordinates, to the
camera's origin position.

OpenSfM, however, chooses **not** to store the "camera origin" in
``Pose`` objects. Instead, it stores the **camera coordinates of the
world origin** in the ``translation`` field.

These obviously depend on the position and, in particular, **rotation**
of the camera. They are automatically calculated by the
``pose.set_origin(origin)`` method, using the **current**
``pose.rotation``.

Because of this dependency, if the camera turns around, the
``translation`` will need updating. But ``pose.set_rotation_matrix()``
**does not do this.** So you should never call ``set_origin()``
**before** ``set_rotation_matrix()``. Only set the origin afterwards.

The case where you only want to change the rotation, while keeping the
position the same, is a bit subtle. You will have to manually update
``pose.translation`` after setting the rotation, but to what? You can't
call ``get_origin()`` *after* updating the rotation, because this will
calculate the origin from ``translation`` using the *new* rotation
instead of the old one. The ``translation`` value only makes sense the
coordinate system that set it. It must be kept in sync with
``rotation``, something that seems to have been overlooked in the version
at the time of writing.

Solution to safely set pose rotation:

.. code:: python

    org = pose.get_origin()      # save where the camera actually is
    pose.set_rotation_matrix(R)  # set the rotation
    pose.set_origin(org)         # update the translation property accordingly...
